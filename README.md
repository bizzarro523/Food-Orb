# Angular FoodOrb App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.3.

## Development server

Begin by watching json servers for data. In separate terminals navigate towards Food-Orb/src/assets/data. Run command `json-server --watch users.json`, `json-server --watch --port 5000 fooditems.json`, `json-server --watch --port 6002 addresses.json`, & `json-server --watch --port 6001 cart.json`. Then run `ng serve -o` for a dev server.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
